I am an M.S. student in the [Multimodal Intelligence Research (MIR) Lab](https://mirlab.yonsei.ac.kr), advised by [Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/). Concurrently, I am a research scientist intern at the Language Lab of [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai/ourwork/research?tab=PB). Before LG AI Research, I was a research scientist intern at the Foundation Research Team in [Naver Cloud](https://www.navercloudcorp.com/lang/en/) and a technical lead for World Model for Robotics and Vehicle Control Team at [maumAI](https://maum.ai/). Before the M.S. degree program, I received a B.A. in Applied Statistics and a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from Yonsei University.

My research goal is to **develop an embodied agent that autonomously discovers and acquires knowledge through experiences**. To this end, I aim to find scalable approaches for how embodied agents can **learn through the physical world without human supervision, not limited to physical constraints**. Currently, I am researching related research topics to achieve efficient long-context multimodal generative models and continual learning through self-supervision for AI alignment.

**🙌 Looking for Ph.D. programs! 🙌**
