I am a Masterâ€™s student inÂ Multimodal Intelligence Research (MIR) Lab at Yonsei University, advised byÂ [Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/). I was a research intern atÂ [Naver Cloud](https://www.navercloudcorp.com/lang/en/) and researched the alignment of [HyperCLOVA X](https://www.ncloud.com/solution/featured/hyperclovax). Before the Masterâ€™s degree,
I received a B.A. in Applied Statistics and a B.S. in Computer Science from Yonsei University.

**Currently, I'm looking for Ph.D courses (2025 Fall)! ðŸ™Œ**
