I am an M.S. student at Yonsei University advised byÂ [Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/) and [Jongmin Lee](https://www.jmlee.kr/). Concurrently, I am a research scientist intern at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Institute in [KIST](https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do). Also I worked at [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai),Â [Naver Cloud](https://www.navercloudcorp.com/lang/en/) and [maumAI](https://maum.ai/). Before the M.S. degree program, I received a B.A. in Applied Statistics and a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from Yonsei University.

My research goal is to **developÂ an embodied agent that autonomously discovers and acquires knowledge through experiences**. To this end, I aim to find scalable approaches for how embodied agents can **learn through the physical world without human supervision, not limited to physical constraints**. Currently, I am researching related research topics to achieve efficient long-context multimodal generative models and continual learning through self-supervision for AI alignment.
