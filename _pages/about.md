I am a Masterâ€™s student inÂ [Multimodal Intelligence Research (MIR) Lab](https://mirlab.yonsei.ac.kr) at Yonsei University, advised byÂ [Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/). I was a research intern atÂ [Naver Cloud](https://www.navercloudcorp.com/lang/en/) and participated in the alignment learning of HyperCLOVA X, a Large Language Model specialized for Korean and English. Also, I was a technical lead for WoRV (World Model for Robotics and Vehicle Control) on [maumAI](https://maum.ai/). Before the Masterâ€™s degree,
I received a B.A. in Applied Statistics and a B.S. in Computer Science from Yonsei University.

**Currently, I'm looking for Ph.D. programs! ðŸ™Œ**
