I am an M.S. student inÂ theÂ [Multimodal Intelligence Research (MIR) Lab](https://mirlab.yonsei.ac.kr), advised byÂ [Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/). Concurrently, I am also a research intern at the Language Lab ofÂ [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai/ourwork/research?tab=PB). Before LG AI Research, I was a research intern atÂ the Foundation Research Team inÂ [Naver Cloud](https://www.navercloudcorp.com/lang/en/) and a technical lead for WoRV (World Model for Robotics and Vehicle Control) at [maumAI](https://maum.ai/). Before the M.S. degree program, I received a B.A. in Applied Statistics and a B.S. in Computer Science from Yonsei University.

My research goal is to **developÂ an embodied agent that autonomously discovers and acquires knowledge through experience**. To this end, I aim to find scalable approaches for how embodied agents can **learn through the physical world without human supervision, not limited to physical constraints**. Currently, I am researching related research topics for efficient long-context multimodal generative models and continual learning from self-supervision.
