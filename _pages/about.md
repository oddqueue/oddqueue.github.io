I am an M.S. candidate at Yonsei University advised by [Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/) and [Jongmin Lee](https://www.jmlee.kr/). Concurrently, I am a research scientist intern at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Institute in [KIST](https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do). I previously researched at [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai), [Naver Cloud](https://www.navercloudcorp.com/lang/en/) and [maumAI](https://maum.ai/). Before the M.S. degree program, I received a B.A. in Applied Statistics and a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from Yonsei University. My research aims to **enable end-to-end continual multimodal learning for accumulating knowledge from real-world embodied experience without human supervision**. I strive to achieve this goal by a scalable yet simple approach. I am currently interested in multimodal generative models, AI alignment for Robotics, and parameterized memory for continual learning.

**🙌 Looking for Ph.D. programs! 🙌**
